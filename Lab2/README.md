# Lab 2: Social Engineering Tools (SET, BeEF, and Phishing)

## Overview
This lab explores the use of social engineering tools to simulate attacks that exploit human vulnerabilities in cybersecurity. The tools used include:
- **SET (Social Engineering Toolkit):** Used to create malicious USB drives and phishing emails.
- **BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework):** Hooked browsers to gather information and execute commands.
- **Phishing Techniques:** Simulated attacks using cloned websites and email campaigns.

## Objectives
- Understand and implement social engineering attacks.
- Gain hands-on experience with SET and BeEF.
- Learn to create phishing simulations and analyze their outcomes.

## Key Activities
1. **Malicious USB Creation:**
   - Generated a reverse shell payload using SET.
   - Deployed it on a target Windows VM to establish a reverse connection.

2. **Browser Exploitation Using BeEF:**
   - Hooked target browsers and gathered sensitive information.
   - Exploited browser vulnerabilities to execute JavaScript commands.

3. **Phishing Simulations:**
   - Conducted phishing tests using various online tools.
   - Created cloned websites for credential harvesting.

## Tools Used
- **SET (Social Engineering Toolkit)**
- **BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework)**
- **Kali Linux**

## Results
- Successfully executed a reverse shell via a malicious USB.
- Identified browser vulnerabilities using BeEF and extracted critical data.
- Highlighted risks associated with phishing and credential harvesting.

## Lessons Learned
- The importance of employee awareness and training to combat social engineering attacks.
- The need for robust browser and email security configurations.
